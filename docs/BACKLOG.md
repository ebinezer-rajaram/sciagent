# Backlog

Per SPEC §13: the design is frozen. New ideas enter here with a rationale and a
note on which frozen decision they would touch. Architecture changes only on a
demonstrated contradiction — a case where two frozen decisions cannot both be
satisfied, documented with the failing test.

This is not the build backlog. The ordered build backlog is SPEC §11, and its
live cursor comes from `scripts/status.py`. Decisions already taken go in
`docs/DECISIONS.md`.

Entry format:

```
## Short title

**Idea.** What it is.
**Rationale.** Why it might be worth doing.
**Touches.** Which frozen decision it would change, or "none".
```

## Known backlog at freeze

Recorded in SPEC §13, restated here so this file is not empty: full
likelihood-free engine, two-step-lookahead BOED, remaining variants and
baselines, the 104-scenario benchmark, grammar sensitivity analysis (R5), the
Rust market environment, real-data grounding, identifiability work,
multi-provider evaluation, independent human study.
