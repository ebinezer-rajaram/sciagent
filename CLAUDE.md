# sciagent

Research framework for evaluating constrained agentic scientific investigation
under model misspecification. Full design: `docs/SPEC.md`. Read it before
non-trivial work. It is frozen; do not propose architectural changes.

## What this is

Environments are compositional executable programmes. Defects are typed
structural edits to those programmes. A research system investigates which
edit was applied. We evaluate LLM-based systems against conventional
baselines on scenarios with known ground truth.

## Non-negotiable invariants

Violating any of these is a bug regardless of tests passing.

1. **`sciagent/` never imports from `environments/`.** The framework is
   domain-independent. There is a test for this. Do not weaken it.
2. **The framework writes numbers; agents write structure.** No code path
   reachable from an agent may set `plausibility`, a posterior value, a
   metric definition, or a score. Enforce with runtime assertions, not
   comments.
3. **Bit-exact determinism.** Same seed + same config + same version =>
   byte-identical output. All randomness through explicitly passed seeded
   generators. Never `random.` or bare `np.random.`. No dict/set iteration
   order dependence in anything affecting output.
4. **The registry is append-only.** No update or delete path exists. Content-
   addressed by hash over (env version, config, data version, metric version,
   seed).
5. **Acceptance tests are the contract.** A1-A24 in `docs/SPEC.md` §6. A
   subsystem is not done until its tests pass. Do not proceed past a gate.
6. **No LLM code until backlog item 12.** Items 2-11 are pure conventional
   machinery. This is deliberate: the evaluation apparatus must be validated
   before the agent exists.

## Stack

- Python 3.12+, `uv` for dependencies (`uv add`, `uv run`)
- `pytest` + `hypothesis` for property-based testing
- `numpy`, `scipy`; `numba` only if profiling justifies it
- Strict typing: `mypy --strict` clean. `from __future__ import annotations`
- `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for all value types. No mutable global state

## Conventions

- Small modules, one concept each. Prefer explicit over clever.
- Type aliases (`ComponentId`, `Seed`, `Probability`) via `NewType`, not bare `str`/`float`.
- Every public function gets a docstring stating what it guarantees, not what it does.
- Errors are typed exceptions from `sciagent.core.errors`, never bare `ValueError`.
- No I/O in `core/`. Pure functions only.

## Working style

- **Ask before assuming.** If the spec is ambiguous, ask rather than picking.
  Ambiguity in the spec is a real finding worth surfacing.
- **Tests first for anything with an acceptance criterion.** Write the A-test,
  watch it fail, then implement.
- Run `uv run pytest` and `uv run mypy --strict sciagent` before saying done.
- Commit at each working state with a message naming the backlog item.
- If something in the spec seems wrong, say so. Do not silently work around it.

## Current position

Backlog items 2-3. See `docs/SPEC.md` §11.
